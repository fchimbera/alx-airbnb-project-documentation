## ðŸ“š What Are User Stories?

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user who desires a new capability. They typically follow the format:

> _"As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."_

User stories are used primarily in Agile development to define system behavior without specifying how that behavior is implemented.

### âœ¨ Importance of User Stories
- **User-Centric**: Keeps the development team focused on delivering value to real users.
- **Clarity**: Breaks down complex systems into manageable, understandable parts.
- **Communication**: Serves as a common language between developers, stakeholders, and users.
- **Prioritization**: Helps product teams rank features by importance and user impact.
